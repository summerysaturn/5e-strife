# D&D - Strife

This is an online character sheet that I'm creating using React, Bootstrap and JSON. Currently not everything is implemented, although the site is up at <https://summerysaturn.github.io/dnd-strife/>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

This command builds, just the same as `npm run build`, except also publishing it to github pages. The url is written in `package.json`, and should be replaced if you aren't a contributor (me).
